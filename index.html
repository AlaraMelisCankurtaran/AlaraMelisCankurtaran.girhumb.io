        <h3>My Day In A Nutshell                 </h3>
        <p>My dad woke me up around 7:30 because I had to get my passport picture taken. We drove to UNCC And got my picture taken. Then we went to Concord Mills and bought Christmas present and clothes. We also went bungee jumping. For lunch we had Burger King and Pizza. We had to go home because we had a private tennis lesson but, we got canceled on. So we did nothing but be on technology. I uploaded a youtube video and then we had a movie night. I watched some satisfying videos in bed then went to sleep around 11:00              </p>
        <h3>Getting My Passport Picture          </h3>
        <p>My dad woke me up at 7:32 because I had to go and take my passport picture because it was expired. We drove to UNCC (My mom's work) to take the photo. We drove around looking for my mom when she was inside the whole time. We finally found her. We had to take the picture twice because In the first one my hair was a mess.                </p>
        <h3>Going to Concord Mills Mall          </h3>
        <p>After taking my passport picture, me, my dad, and my sister went to the mall. The first store we went in was Kirklands. We bought Christmas gifts for mom. Because we were so close to the entrance of the building, we played a three way rock paper siccisors and the winner would put the gifts back in the car. My sister ended up winning and she took so long. After Kirklands we went into a clothing store but found nothing. Then we went to a store where they sold Simply Southern clothing. We then went to a store that was<strong> VERY</strong> expensive, but we did buy slippers for our mom. We ended up going to TJ Maxx. We spent a very VERY long time there. I ended up getting a Christmas Sweater with Rudolph on it and real and fake ornaments, and a shirt with a unicorn with antlers on it. My sister bought some shirts and a pants. Also for my mom we bought a christmas wine topper. After TJ Maxx we put our stuff away and went into a swim shop. We bought Clothes for our elves and we played a shooting game. After that shop we went BUNGEE JUMPING!!!!! Our dad at first said no, but luckily the guy who does the bungee jumping heard me and my sister begging our dad in Turkish and he was Turkish! So he lowered the price and we got on the bungee jumps. My sister learned how to do a backflip and front flip, and I learned how to do a frontflip and a double backflip. After bungee jumping we went into a store to look for wine glasses for our mom, but found nothing. Then we went into build a bear but we also bought nothing from there. After Build a bear we had lunch. My sister had pizza, and I had a jr. whopper from burger king, and my dad had a whopper. Then we left because we had to get to a private tennis lesson.</p>
        <h3>Home                                      </h3>
        <p>When we got home we started getting ready for tennis. When I was going down stairs my dad told us that our coach, Mariana, canceled because she had something to do. So we just went on technology.                            </p>
        <h3>Boring Stuff                               </h3>
        <p>My sister and I were playing a game together on our phones, but then we got bored so I started watching youtube on my phone. I watched how this girl babysat a girl she thought was possesed. And how the same girl had a 'haunted' stuffed animal. I got bored and watched someone play the Sims 4, and I liked it so I tried playing it but it didn't work. So I went on my dad's computer and played roblox. First I played Fashion Famous, then I played obbys. I made a youtube video on playing roblox. Then my dad called me over for movie night.</p>
        <h3>Movie Night                               </h3>
        <p>My dad called me over to watch a movie with him, my sister, and my mom. We were going to watch I Am Legend (A zombie movie) but my mom said no. So we watched the new karate kid movie. We also had pizza from Papa John's. I had meat pizza and chicken, and for desert; Chocolate brownies.</p>

        <h3>Sleeping                                  </h3>
        <p>After the movie was over my mom yelled at me and my sister to go to sleep. So I took my pill (Because I got sick) and brushed my teeth, put on p.js, turned on my unicorn night light and went to sleep. Before I went to sleep I watched satisfying slime videos. After the videos were over I turned off my night light and turned on my white noise maker and tryed to go to sleep. But I couldn't sleep because it was so noisy. so I turned the noise maker off and went to sleep around 11:00.                                         </p>

   <h3>My day in a nutshell                          </h3>
   <p>I woke up around 7:30 and did some coding in my room. Then I watched some Riverdale. I went dwonstairs and completed my coding. I played Roblox with my sister until my mom said we had to go clean our rooms, the area between our rooms, and the game room. When we finished we played more roblox until it was time to getready to to go to North Harbor Club for a Thanksgiving feast with our grandparents. After that we got home and me and my sister made musicallys together. Then our mom told us we had to go to bed so we went to sleep around 11:00.

   <h3>The Morning                                   </h3>
   <p>I woke around 7:30 and got my Chromebook to do some coding in my room. I got bored of that so I watched some episodes of Riverdale. My room was getting really uncomfortable so I went down stairs to finish coding. When I finished coding I played Roblox games with my sister Tuana. Our mom came home from work out and brought our food. She also told us that in 10 minutes we would have to go clean our rooms, the are between our rooms, and the game room.           </p>
   <h3>Cleaning</h3>
   <p>When 10 minutes was up me and my sister went up the stairs to clean the game room. I didn't help for at least 5 minutes. Then Tuana (my sister) kept asking if we were done with the game room but I kept saying no. After we finished we quickly cleaned the area between our rooms and then we started on our rooms. Tuana finished quickly so she helped me clean my room. While we were cleaning I was trying to hang something up on my hanger and it broke down!! When we finished we also had to take clothes up to our rooms and put them in our closets. </p>
   <h3>Getting Ready for Thanksgiving                    </h3>
   <p>When we finished cleaning we went back to playing Roblox. But then our mom told us to go and get ready to go to North Harbor Club for Thanksgiving with our grand parents. I wore a white off the shoulder shirt with blue jeggings and boots. I put makeup on, but I had to pretend I was brushing my hair because my dad was upstairs and he does not like makeup. I went downstairs and got my phone and head phones. When we got in the car I realized that one of my headphone ears were not working. Then none of them worked! Once we got to North Harbor Club I realized I had forgotten my jacket, and sadly it was cold outside.

   <h3>Thanksgiving Feast                                </h3>
   <p>We had reserved a spot outside and the outside was covered by this cool mini cloth house. Our grandparents came and we had to move tables because we were so close to where people would get food and that would bother us. For the main course I had Turkey, ham, mashed potatoes with gravy, strawberries, and green beans. The ham was the best so I got a lot of seconds. For desert everyone got to pick thier own thing, and I picked apple pie and it had a salted caramel Ice cream scoop on top. When I finished Me and Tuana played charades on my phone.                                    </p>
   <h3>Home                                              </h3>
        <p>When we got home me and Tuana changed into our p.js. Me and her started making musicallys on our phones. My phone died so I asked Tuana if she wanted to play. She said yes and we played a game with Barbies until we got bored. Then we started making musicallys on her phone. We made at least 12. Then it was time to go to bed.                            </p>
    
        <h3>Sleeping                                     </h3>
    
        <p>My sister asked my mom if we could sleep together and she said yes, so me and Tuana slept in Tuana's room. We stayed up talking about stories from our old preschool Primrose. Then we decided to go to sleep. I couldn't sleep in her room so I moved to my room. I couldn't sleep at first because of the T.V that my dad was watching but eventually I fell asleep around 11:00.                                </p>

        <h3>My Day In A Nutshell                         </h3>
        <p>I woke up around 8:00 And went downstairs to play roblox. But something happened so I just went around doing nothing. Eventually I decided to do some coding, but I got frustrated so I stoped. Then I was told to get ready for a post Thanksgiving dinner with our cousins and grandparents. So we got ready and went to our grandparents house. We had Turkey, corn casserole, brussle sprouts, etc. When we finished we had dessert which was pie, and cookies. Then me, my sister, and my cousins made musicallys together. Then we went home and we had to immediately go to bed my mom said. So I went to sleep around 10:00.                                            </p>
        <h3>Home                                         </h3>
        <p>I woke up around 8:00 and went downstairs to play roblox. My dad's computer kept going into power save mode so I couldn't play so I decided to do coding. I couldn't get the links to work so I got frustrated with my chromebook. So I tryed to go back to roblox but it didn't work. So I watched some youtube. Then I thought I should try and do the coding again but the internet wasn't working, so that made me frustrated again. Then my mom told my sister, and I to get ready to go to our grandparents house for a post Thanksgiving dinner with our cousins who came all the way from Wilmington. I wore a shirt that said made of magic with black leggings, black boots, and my hair was in a half up half down braid.              </p>
        <h3>Grandparents House                         </h3>
        <p>When we got to our grandparents house, our cousins weren't there because they were doing black friday shopping, so me and my sister went on our phones. About an hour later our cousins came. At first we were all just on our phones, but then we all went to the living room and watched Nailed It until it was time for dinner.
            
                                                       </p>
        <h3>Post Thanksgiving Dinner                   </h3>
        <p>For dinner I had turkey, mashed potatoes, corn casserole, brussle sprouts, and water. After everyone finished we had dessert. Me and my cousin Maia went and put some cookies in the oven, then me, Maia, Tuana (my sister), and Bella (my other cousin) had cookie dough. Our grandma took out pie and me and Maia tryed pumpkin pie. For desert I had apple pie, three cookies, and rocky road ice cream.          </p>
        <h3>After Dinner                               </h3>
        <p>After dinner me, Maia, and Tuana went outside so I could try the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itUJlwpi3Wo">Whipped Cream Challenge</a>. But I failed, and made a mess outside. After that we all made musicallys on Tuana's phone. We made at least 10 privates and 1 public. But then my sister posted all the privates. After we got bored of making musicallys, we all went on our phones. When we got bored Maia taught me and Tuana <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935">how to screen record on our iphones</a>, and no hand slowmo musicallys. When we learned that we made no hand slowmo musicallys. Then it was time to go home because Bella and Maia were going to go to sleep.                </p>
